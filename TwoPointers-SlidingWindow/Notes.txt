Two Pointers Technique
✅ Idea:
Use two pointers (variables) to iterate through a data structure (usually an array or string) from different directions or at different speeds.

✅ Use cases:
Searching pairs in a sorted array

Reversing arrays or strings

Merging sorted arrays

Removing duplicates

Sliding Window Technique
✅ Idea:
Use a "window" (a subset of elements) that slides over the array to find a condition (e.g., max/min sum, length, etc.)

✅ Use cases:
Maximum/minimum sum of subarrays

Longest substring without repeating characters

Counting occurrences in subarrays
