🧩 STEP 3: DSA PATTERNS (Most Important)

Patterns help solve 1000+ problems with just 20–25 templates.

⭐ Pattern 1: Sliding Window

Used for subarrays, substring, max/min window size.

🔑 Learn:

Fixed window

Variable window

Longest substring problems

📌 Problems:

Max Sum Subarray

Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

Minimum Window Substring (hard)

▶ Resource:

NeetCode Sliding Window Playlist (best)

⭐ Pattern 2: Two Pointers

Used for sorted arrays, collision pointers.

📌 Problems:

Pair Sum

3Sum, 4Sum

Remove duplicates

Valid Palindrome

▶ Resource:

Kunal Kushwaha’s array playlist

⭐ Pattern 3: Fast & Slow Pointers

Linked list focused.

📌 Problems:

Cycle detection

Middle of LinkedList

Happy Number

⭐ Pattern 4: Binary Search Patterns

Not just mid — learn Binary Search on Answer.

📌 Problems:

First/Last Occurrence

Peak Element

Allocate Books / Painters Partition

Koko Eating Bananas

▶ Resource:

⭐ Pattern 5: Prefix Sum & Hashing

Used in ranges and frequency problems.

📌 Problems:

Subarray Sum = K

Longest subarray with 0 sum

Range prefix queries

⭐ Pattern 6: BFS / DFS (Graph Pattern)

Graphs = 20% syllabus but 40% interview problems.

📌 Problems:

Number of Islands

Rotting Oranges

Shortest Path

Topological Sort (Kahn’s Algorithm)

▶ Resource:

Take U Forward Graph Playlist

⭐ Pattern 7: Backtracking

Used in recursion + choices-based problems.

📌 Problems:

Permutations

N-Queens

Subsets

Sudoku Solver

▶ Resource:

NeetCode Backtracking playlist

⭐ Pattern 8: Heap / Priority Queue

Used for top-K, scheduling, merging.

📌 Problems:

K Closest Elements

Merge K Sorted Lists

Kth Largest

Median in data stream

⭐ Pattern 9: Dynamic Programming (DP)

Start with DP on 1D, then 2D, then subsequences.

Learn DP in this order:

Fibonacci DP

Climbing Stairs

Knapsack (important)

Subset Sum

Partition DP

DP on Strings

DP on Trees

DP on Graphs

▶ Resource:

DP Playlist by Aditya Verma (gold standard)

Striver DP Series (A-Z)

⭐ Pattern 10: Trees + BST Patterns

📌 Problems:

Inorder, preorder, postorder

Height / diameter

Lowest Common Ancestor

Validate BST

Boundary Traversal
